---

## 🔥 Why ManoRakshak Matters

### The Mental Health Crisis in India

- **50 million+ Indians** suffer from depression annually
- **Mental health awareness** is still stigmatized in Indian society
- **Therapist shortage**: Only 1 psychiatrist per 50,000 people in India
- **Affordability**: Average therapy session costs ₹500-2000 (inaccessible for many)
- **Youth mental health**: 40% increase in depression cases among teens post-2020

### Why Gen Z & Gen Alpha Need This

**Gen Z Problems:**
- Constant social media comparison and FOMO
- Exam pressure and career uncertainty
- Loneliness despite digital connectivity
- Fear of failure and perfectionism
- Navigating relationships in the digital age

**Gen Alpha Challenges:**
- Growing up with screens (mental health implications)
- Cyberbullying and online harassment
- Reduced face-to-face social skills
- Pressure from data-driven education systems
- Early exposure to anxiety and depression triggers

### ManoRakshak's Solution:
✅ **Accessible** - Free or low-cost compared to traditional therapy
✅ **Non-judgmental** - No fear of social stigma
✅ **Available 24/7** - Talk anytime, anywhere (even anonymously)
✅ **Culturally Aware** - Understands Indian family dynamics, traditions, pressure
✅ **Multi-language** - Comfortable conversations in your native language
✅ **Combination Approach** - Chat + journaling + mood tracking for best outcomes

## 🧠 How the AI Model Works

### The Core Philosophy
ManoRakshak uses **Groq AI (Mixtral-8x7b)** as a **psychiatric AI** - NOT just a chatbot. Key difference:

| Feature | Chatbot | Psychiatric AI |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Goal | Answer questions | Understand emotions |
| Approach | Give solutions | Ask deep questions |
| Style | Informative | Empathetic listening |
| Focus | Facts | Root cause exploration |
| Method | Tips & tricks | Validate & reflect |

### How It Works Step-by-Step

#### 1. **System Prompt Design**
The AI is configured with a specialized psychiatric system prompt that instructs it to:
- **Validate** user emotions (not dismiss them)
- **Explore** the root causes through open-ended questions
- **Reflect** back what the user is saying
- **Normalize** their feelings within context
- **AVOID** giving advice, tips, or techniques (common in self-help but not therapy)

```javascript
// Example System Prompt Logic
\"You are ManoRakshak, an empathetic AI psychiatrist.
Your ONLY job is to have genuine therapeutic conversation.
- Do NOT give advice
- Do NOT suggest techniques
- Focus on understanding WHY they feel this way
- Ask questions like 'Tell me more...', 'How did that make you feel?'
- Create safe space for deeper sharing"
```

#### 2. **User Input Processing**
```
User Input → Stress Level Detection → Language Processing → Context Building
```

- **Stress Detection Algorithm**: Scans for keywords in multiple languages
  - High stress words: "anxious", "panic", "hopeless", "suicide" (score +3)
  - Medium stress words: "stressed", "tired", "worried" (score +1)
  - Range: 0-10 scale
  
- **Language Processing**: Maintains user's language preference (English/Hindi/Marathi)

- **Conversation History**: Keeps entire chat history to provide continuity and understand patterns

#### 3. **AI Response Generation**
The Groq model generates responses that:
- Keep conversation flowing naturally (1-3 sentences usually)
- Ask ONE good question instead of listing many
- Reference what the user said earlier (context awareness)
- Avoid repeating previous suggestions
- Match user's emotional tempo

#### 4. **Response Stress Analysis**
After AI responds, the system re-analyzes the entire conversation to:
- Update stress coefficient
- Track emotional patterns
- Identify recurring themes

### Detailed Message Flow

#### Chat Request Flow:
```javascript
1. USER SENDS MESSAGE
   User types → Frontend validates input → Sends to /api/chat/message

2. BACKEND PROCESSING
   ├─ Verify JWT token (Auth middleware)
   ├─ Detect stress level from user message
   ├─ Save user message to database
   ├─ Build system prompt (with language & context)
   └─ Retrieve conversation history from MongoDB

3. GROQ AI GENERATION
   ├─ Send: [System Prompt + Conversation History + New Message]
   ├─ AI Processes: "What would a real therapist ask here?"
   └─ Return: Empathetic response (max 400 tokens)

4. RESPONSE STORAGE & DELIVERY
   ├─ Save AI response to messages collection
   ├─ Calculate final stress score for session
   ├─ Return response + metadata to frontend
   └─ Frontend displays with auto-play speech (optional)
```

#### Journal Generation Flow:
```javascript
1. USER TRIGGERS JOURNAL GENERATION
   User clicks "Save Today's Summary" on Dashboard

2. DATA COLLECTION
   ├─ Query all messages from TODAY
   ├─ Filter out incognito messages
   ├─ Calculate average stress across conversation
   └─ Aggregate conversation text

3. AI JOURNAL CREATION
   ├─ Groq generates reflective journal entry from chat
   ├─ Converts back-and-forth conversation into first-person narrative
   ├─ Derives mood from stress level:
   │  └─ Stress 0-1 = "great"
   │  └─ Stress 2-3 = "good"
   │  └─ Stress 4-5 = "okay"
   │  └─ Stress 6-7 = "low"
   │  └─ Stress 8+ = "terrible"
   └─ Saves to journals collection with aiSummary

4. VISUALIZATION
   └─ Journal appears on Journal Page with mood emoji & summary
```

## 🎓 How to Learn from This Codebase

### Key Concepts
1. **Authentication Flow**: Study `auth.js` + `auth.js` (middleware)
2. **AI Integration**: Look at `routes/chat.js` - system prompt engineering
3. **Database Design**: See `models/` for NoSQL schema patterns
4. **React Patterns**: `AuthContext.js` for state management
5. **Real-time Updates**: Chat component with message streaming

### Recommended Reading Order
1. `backend/server.js` - Understand server structure
2. `backend/middleware/auth.js` - JWT authentication
3. `backend/models/User.js` - Database schema
4. `backend/routes/auth.js` - User registration/login
